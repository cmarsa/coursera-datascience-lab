# Principles of Analytic Graphics

## Principle 1: Show Comparisons
- Evidence for a hypothesis is always *relative* to another competing hypothesis.
- Always ask "Compared to What?"

## Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
- What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?
- How do we think the system works?

## Principle 3: Show multivariate data
- Multivariate = more than 2 variables
- The real world is multivariate
- Need to "escape flatland"

## Principle 4: Integration of evidence
- Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
- Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
- Don't ley the tool drive the analysis

## Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.
- A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible

## Principle 6: Content is king
- Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending
on the quality, relevance and integrity of their content.
